# React-Native candidate assignment
The goal of the developer assignment is to take a quick dive into a React Native project and build a two screen weather app.

### Timelines and Contact
Expected time of completion is around 2-4 hours of development, fitting the minimum requirements. If there are any questions or troubles, developer candidates may reach out to Nico Martens, nico.martens@basic-fit.com to get assistance.

### Setup and Running
We have setup a basic React-Native app as a starting point for you Basic-Fit Tech weather app. You can use any packages, libraries as you like to meet the minimal requirements of this assignment.

### Turning In
Once you are satisfied in your progress, please return a link to your forked codebase to Nico (or the contact that had assigned this homework).

## Project script
For this assignment we assume we are building an application that shows us the weather at our offices and clubs. But a first iteration will be that we want to know the weather for our Tech office in Tilburg and the HQ in Hoofddorp. 
### Data
We picked Weatherstack ([docs](https://weatherstack.com/documentation)) as our source for getting the weather data. Feel free to use other sources if you want or feel more comfortable with. See the example url below for an API access key to use so you don't have to go through the hassle to create an account 

example: http://api.weatherstack.com/current?access_key=e00d38898be8c31d51aeade6e5c15307&query=Tilburg
