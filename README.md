# React-Native candidate assignment
The goal of the developer assignment is to take a quick dive into a React Native project and build a two screen weather app.

### Timelines and Contact
Expected time of completion is around 2-4 hours of development, fitting the minimum requirements. If there are any questions or troubles, developer candidates may reach out to Nico Martens, nico.martens@basic-fit.com to get assistance.

### Setup and Running
We have setup a basic React-Native app as a starting point for you Basic-Fit Tech weather app. You can use any packages, libraries as you like to meet the minimal requirements of this assignment.

### Turning In
Once you are satisfied in your progress, please return a link to your forked codebase to Nico (or the contact that had assigned this homework).

-------------------

## Project script
For this assignment we assume we are building an application that shows us the weather at our offices and clubs. But a first iteration will be that we want to know the weather for our Tech office in Tilburg and the HQ in Hoofddorp. 
### Data
There are plenty of weather APIs available so pick one of your liking and used that to gather the weather data for the wanted locations.

### Screens
#### Basic-Fit Tech
This screen should minimally show the current weather of the Tech office in Tilburg.
#### Basic-Fit HQ
This screen should minimally show the current weather of the HQ in Hoofddorp.

### Extra credit
- Extended weather information (for the coming days)
